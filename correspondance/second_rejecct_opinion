The authors propose a method to generate topologically distinct paths
on a grid map. Unfortunately, the paper is not accepted for the
following reasons:

To begin with, the authors needs to point out clearly the potential
applications for the proposed method, as the contribution of
topologically distinct path in robotics application is not explained
very well. 
# 指明非同伦拓扑路径在机器人的应用场景

Secondly, the authors did not explain in a clear fashion how distinct
the proposed method is as compared with other SOTA methods. The
benchmarked methods in experiments are not explained very well in
related materials. Furthermore, I believe some ablation study here
would be more persuasive. 
# 清楚解释本文相对其他方法的区别，实验部分

Lastly, there are concerns with the technical soundness of the proposed
methods in more complex cases. How would the method work in 3D? What
would the computational load be like in 3D cases? The methodology
section will need a thorough reconsideration.

作者们提出了一种在网格地图上生成拓扑不同路径的方法。不幸的是，这篇论文因以下原因未被接受：

首先，作者需要清楚地指出所提出方法的潜在应用，因为在机器人应用中，拓扑不同路径的贡献并未解释得很好。（Introduction）
RE: we add more clear description about the contribution of topologically distinct path in robotics application.

其次，作者未能清晰地解释所提出方法与其他最先进方法相比的独特之处。实验中基准方法的解释在相关资料中并不清晰。此外，我认为在这里进行一些割除研究会更具说服力。(Results)
RE: we add ablation study to show how our technique speed up path planning. 

（Ablation study（消融实验）： 可以看出，消融实验的目的在于移除系统中的特定的部分，来控制变量式的研究这个部分对于系统整体的影响。如果去除这一部分后系统的性能没有太大损失，那么说明这一部分对于整个系统而言并不具有太大的重要性；如果去除之后系统性能明显的下降，则说明这一部分的设计是必不可少的。当然，如果出现了第三种情况，也就是去除之后模型的性能不降反升，那么建议找一下bug或者修改设计。）

最后，对于在更复杂情况下所提出方法的技术可靠性存在疑虑。这种方法在三维情况下会如何运作？在三维情况下，计算负载会如何？方法论部分需要进行彻底重新考虑。(Methodology)
RE: we add consideration of 3D cases in Methodology and update the proof about the relationship between locally shortest path and topologically distinctive path
